        Create a webpage for the Happy Trails Travel Agency. The page should have text, images, 
        and links. Feature various travel destinations and get creative!</p>

        Add a class named tropical for tropical destinations. Give the headers the color #f7325e and 
        the text the color #7dc410. Use the fantasy font family.

        Add a class named popular for the most popular destination. Add some styling to distinguish it 
        from the other destination listings. What happens when a popular destination is also a tropical 
        destination?  How can you make sure that the styles you want to see on the page are displayed?
